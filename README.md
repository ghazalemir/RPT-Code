Test8:
These data set test the count while positions change vertically.
For these data set we have both rho<r and rho>r.

Test9:
These data set test the count while positions change horizontally.
For these data set rho<r.

Test16:
These data set test the count while the "x" and "z" axis are fix and particle position change in "y" axis (from -0.1 to 0.1).
For these data set rho<r.


Test17:
These data set test the count while the "x" and "z" axis are fix and particle position change in "y" axis (from -0.1 to 0.1).
For these data set rho>r.

Test14:
